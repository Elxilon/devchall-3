      Where can I see your demo?
  </a>

- What was your experience?

  Very beginner with JS but nothing difficult here on this side, it's my first time I make a "hamburger menu" I tried something "dirty", I probably could get a better code using more JS.

- What have you learned/improved?

  I think, I learned more here the way to use SASS, I built some tricks to have the result I wanted. Maybe not the best, I will see the solutions from others to see what I can improve.
